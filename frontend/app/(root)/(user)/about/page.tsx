      <p className="text-black bg-gray-50 p-4 leading-7 rounded-md">
        In many third world countries, it is most known that there are many
        challenges for the citizens. Some examples are poverty, corruption, poor
        healthcare and education and the issue which 0xDemocracys intend to focus
        on here is election fraud.
      </p>

      <p className="text-black bg-gray-50 p-4 leading-7 rounded-md">
        The way 0xDemocracy attempts to tackle this issue is using blockchain
        technology. 0xDemocracy believes that we can leverage blockchain
        technology to our advantage to achieve a fair decision within elections.

      <p className="text-black bg-gray-50 p-4 leading-7 rounded-md">
        0xDemocracy is about creating an election system for third world countries
        that is secure and tamper resistant. It potentially could significantly
        impact election processes in third world countries. The opportunities
        the blockchain brings are endless and it can be used in many ways if
        implemented correctly.
